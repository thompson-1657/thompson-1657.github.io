Responsive Portfolio

In this repository is my responsive portfolio. Using media queries and bootstrap I have created a three-page portfolio that consists of a home page, a contact page and a portfolio page. Each page has a navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images. All of the pages adapt and respond to various breakpoints in layout representing computer screens, tablets and phone screens. Below are images of each page at the various breakpoints chosen:







The navbar is also responsive and collapses or expands depending on the screen size being used for viewing. This can be seen here:





Using responsive design is imperative in creating a fully functional website that can be viewed across various screen sizes. Utilizing breakpoints and media queries allowed me to create a smooth transition in my content depending on screensize and allows for an optimal user experience overall.
